## Slice 1 — signature correctness (#2 #3 #5) · branch feat/s1-signature-correctness

Scope (from docs/DESIGN-project-model-and-autosetup.md §5):

- **#2 assignment matrix** — recipient owner must have an `ownership` tying them to
  the document's scope (apartment-doc → that apartment; project-doc → any apartment
  in that project). Reject otherwise (`recipient_not_associated`). Single + bulk.
- **#3 expired-dedup** — the "pending exists" guard (single + bulk) must also require
  `expiresAt > now()`; add `expired` to the status CHECK + wire enum (migration 0063,
  `when` > 1782054000000) + backfill `pending`→`expired` where `expires_at <= now()`.
- **#5** — verify the signing page is reachable once #3 is fixed (browser QA).

### Status (live)

- Spec ✅ · Reproduce-RED ✅ (test-author: 3 RED on unfixed, 3 controls green) · Build ✅
  (typecheck 5/5=0, lint clean) · IndepTests ✅ (160 passed; 6 = phase5 E2E failing only
  at the local signup throttle http_429, CI-only; 11 skipped).
- CodeReview ✅ — logic PASS; the 24-spec blocker was RESEEDED with real ownership ties
  (gate NOT weakened) + 2 new tests (bulk-partial, scope-less); D.51 statement in PR #345.
- Security ✅ — authorization PASS (gate fires single+bulk pre-row/token, RLS-clean, no
  leak); Gate-6-Approved trailer in PR #345 (owner autonomous-merge authorization).
- BrowserQA ⚠️ HONEST — live server confirmed running the new code + migration 0063
  (CHECK has 'expired'); dedup enforced live (409 correct); the QA owner verified genuinely
  associated with the doc's project (consistent with the gate). The full positive+negative
  gate is proven by the 6 integration tests (same code path, real DB) + both reviews; a
  STANDALONE live-HTTP fresh-create/negative repro was blocked by QA-fixture friction
  (owner-create DTO + seed-encryption typing + wrong cancel route) — NOT a gate problem. A
  cleaner live UX repro lands with Phase-3 entity-model UI fixtures.
- CI ✅ CLEAN (the 6 phase5 E2E passed under the CI bypass; local http_429 was env-only).
- **Merge-on-green ✅ — PR #345 squash-merged to main as d4769fc (incl. migration 0063).**
- Critic ✅ — open notes: (a) no background sweeper flips newly-lapsing `pending`→`expired`
  going forward (acceptable: the dedup predicate + FE `isExpired` both derive from
  `expires_at`, so correctness holds regardless of a sweep; a cron sweep is a later nicety);
  (b) the standalone LIVE-HTTP negative repro (recipient_not_associated) was blocked by
  QA-fixture friction — re-do cleanly in Phase-3 once UI-level owner/ownership fixtures exist.
- Memory ✅ (project_v12_epic_and_charter).

**SLICE 1 ✅ CLOSED — merged d4769fc.**

Process note: after a squash-merge, sync local main with `git fetch && git reset --hard
origin/main` (NOT `git pull --ff-only`, which fails when local main has superseded commits).

## Slice 2 — invites + documents (#4 #9 #7 #1) · branch feat/s2-invites-docs (next)

Scope: #4/#9 expose the invite + sign link in-app for dev (FakeEmail sends nowhere) + handle
re-invite to an existing email; #7 member resend + copy-link + pending clarity; #1 document
inline VIEW (vs forced download — `Content-Disposition: attachment`). Same pipeline + green gate.

Rule: any real-red → slice stays OPEN with the blocker named here; never force-merge.
